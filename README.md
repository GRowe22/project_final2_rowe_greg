## Resources
* [Visually Hidden](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/src/css/main.css#L107-L169) I used boilerplate code to remove headings that created html structure, but were not visually necessary.
* [Button Style](http://www.corelangs.com/css/box/hover.html) I tried to get the button to change image backgrounds, but was unable to without height and width...this just didn't look right with responsive design.


## Deductions
* I reviewed the list of deductions for this project
and in the syllabus.


## Comments
* I struggled with the responsive design and button with hover.
* Ultimately, I decided to go with an image with hover effect since I could never really get the button tag to come out like I wanted.
* I know the button is oversized in some of the design, but I like the exaggerated effect to show the style.
